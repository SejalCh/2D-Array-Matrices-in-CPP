# 2D-Array-Matrices-in-CPP

##**AIM**: To study about 2D-Array/Matrices in C++

##**THEORY**:

<p>In C++, we can create an array of an array, known as a multidimensional array.Instead of having just a row or column (like in array), 2D array consists a net of rows and columns. It is also known as matrix/matrices.It consists of elemets which are nothing but values of any data type.<br>
Various operations that can be performed on matrices are:<br>
1.sum of matrices<br>
2.multiplication of matrices<br>
3.tranpose of a matrix.<br>

To compute the matrices we first need to iterate it in certain range using for loop and then type the command we want it to perform.</p>

##**Syntax**:<br>
(data type)(variable name)([x][y]); where x and y represents the no. of rows and columns respectively.<br>
